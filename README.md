# VREnabler ML

This is a Melon Loader plugin which enables VR in Unity games that rely on the old VR Module (2017/2018).

Plugins folder contents are omitted. The class database file isn't distributed with this repo but is accessible [here](https://github.com/nesrak1/AssetsTools.NET/releases)

## Configuration

The plugin offers a small configuration file to enable/disable VR support and to force SinglePassStereo mode (this requires to also copy unity resources from a project built with SinglePassStereo mode enabled).
